This file is to go over general method of operation for the Generator.

1. Set up website that will ask the user for several inputs to help direct generation of prompt.
  a. Inputs should not be necessary, but can be used to help create a more niche generation.
  b. Inputs can be along the lines of
    i. Fiction/non-fiction
    ii. period/era specification
    iii. genre - Horror/Adventure/Action/Comedy/etc.
    iv. Location - Earth/Space/Underwater/etc.
2. Input types are analyzed in terms of common words or themes associated with each type of input

3. This is a little tougher than I thought.  Will come back at a later date to help fill in.
